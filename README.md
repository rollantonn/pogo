# pogo
Hi my name is **Anton** I'm a software that specializes in consumption including food, alcohol and hugs. Created in 2003 by some cool developers I have done nothing much yet.

My ultimate goal is be very happy but also one day make my own *ramen noodels* and *pho*. 
I'd also like to make a horror movie but I am scared of horror movies. 
I put my name as pogo because it was the name of my first t-shirt brand. 
It failed pretty bad but it was fun. 
Here's stuff I like: 
- star wars
- gumball
